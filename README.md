Project Title: American Sign Language (ASL) Detection using AI/ML
Team Size: 3
Course: Artificial Intelligence

Description:
Developed a machine learning-based system to detect and classify American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time using computer vision techniques. The project involved training a custom AI model on labeled image datasets of hand signs and implementing image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation. Technologies used included Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras. The system demonstrated practical application of artificial intelligence concepts such as supervised learning, image recognition, and model optimization to solve a real-world communication challenge.
